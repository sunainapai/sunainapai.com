<!-- tag: technology -->
<p>
Download <code>MacVim-snapshot-73-Mavericks.tbz</code> from
<a href="https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/releases">https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/releases</a>.
(Note: The binary requires Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later. It will
not run on earlier versions of Mac OS X!)
</p>

<p>
To install, drag the <code>MacVim.app</code> to the
<code>Applications</code> folder. You are good to go by double clicking
this MacVim icon.
</p>

<p>
To start MacVim from Terminal, set the <code>PATH</code> enviroment
variable to include the location where the <code>mvim</code> script has
to be found. To do this move the <code>mvim</code> script to your
favourite location, which in my case is <code>/Users/sunaina/bin</code>
and add this path to <code>/etc/paths</code>.
</p>

<p>
To set <code>PATH</code>, enter the following command on Terminal.
</p>

<pre>
sudo vi /etc/paths
</pre>

<p>
Enter your password and you will see all the paths you have. Add
<code>the path to the mvim script</code> to this file, save and quit.
Open a new Terminal. You should be able to start MacVim from Terminal
with the following command.
</p>

<pre>
mvim
</pre>

<p>
You can customize your MacVim to suit your needs. For doing this create
a <code>.vimrc</code> file at your home location. You can download my
customizations from <a
