<!-- title: Alleppey Trip 2015 -->
<!-- tag: trip -->
<p>
In November 2015, <a href="/blog/munnar-trip-2015/"> after spending 2 nights at Munnar</a>,
we headed to Alappuzha also known as Alleppey. It took us about 4.5
hours to reach our place of stay by taxi from Munnar. We stayed at
<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g608471-d3578613-Reviews-Deshadan_Backwater_Resort-Alappuzha_Alappuzha_District_Kerala.html">Deshadan Backwater Resort</a>.
The resort is a small and cozy place with a swimming pool overlooking
the backwaters. We chose this resort as we wanted to experience the
backwaters of Kerala. It is our first backwater resort. &#x1f60a;

On day 2, we went to Marari Beach and spent a few hours there. It is
about 20 minutes drive from the resort. Marari Beach is lined by coconut
trees, has white sand and clear blue water. There were no restaurants in
this place. We had home cooked Kerala style boiled rice and fish, and
very refreshing orange juice at a small shack. Marari Beach Resort is
located here if one wishes to stay by the sea beach instead of the
backwaters.

We then headed to Alleppey Beach which is about 30 minutes drive from
Marari Beach. Alleppey Beach has remains of an old pier known as the
Alappuzha Sea Bridge.

On day 3, we went on a Shikara ride from the resort to backwaters in
Kumarkom. It was a very peaceful ride. We went through some canals and
passed by coconut lagoons. However the three hour ride felt a little too
long; a standard one hour ride would have sufficed. One can choose to
take houseboat package that includes dinner prepared by in-house chef
and overnight stay on the backwaters. I saw the houseboats from the
outside, they did not look very appealing to me and we were glad to have
stayed only at the resort.

We spent most of the time in the swimming pool, walking around the pool,
watching the backwaters and eating at the floating restaurant. The
resort is a good option for anyone looking for a relaxing getaway in
Alleppey backwaters.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we returned to Bangalore. We wish to visit the backwaters
sometime again. We plan to stay on the Kumarakom side of Vembanad Lake
on our next visit.
