<!-- title: Kovalam Trip 2016 -->
<!-- tag: trip -->
<p>
Kovalam means a grove of coconut palm trees. We were mesmerized by one
such picture of Kovalam at an airport in one of our earlier trips. Since
then Kovalam was on our wishlist.
</p>

<p>
In March 2016, we went on a trip to Kovalam. Our trip started with an
early morning flight to Trivandrum. We hired a taxi at Trivandrum
Airport and reached Kovalam in 40 minutes. We stayed at
<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g311295-d1585591-Reviews-Soma_Palmshore_Beach_Resort-Kovalam_Thiruvananthapuram_District_Kerala.html">Soma
Palmshore Beach Resort</a>,
in Kovalam.
</p>

<p>
Kovalam has three beaches: the Lighthouse Beach, Hawah Beach and Samudra
Beach. They are crescent shaped and located next to each other. Out of
these three, the Lighthouse Beach is very popular among tourists. Light
House Beach got its name from the Vizhinjam Lighthouse. The shallow
waters make it ideal for swimming. One can learn to surf or go on speed
boat rides at this beach. One can also rent beach chairs with umbrella
and watch the pristine beach, read a book, or simply get lost in
thoughts while listening to the waves as we did on most days. &#x1f60a;

Hawah Beach is adjacent to the Lighthouse Beach. Hawah Beach had lot of
fishing activity going on. Samudra Beach is adjacent to Hawah beach.
Samudra Beach was crowded with locals in the evening.

<p>
Kovalam Beach is lined by an elevated pavement known as Kovalam Beach
Road with various shops, restaurants and hotels. The restaurants provide
a good view of the beach and serve sea food. As opposed to Goa, Kovalam
has a laid back lifestyle. Most foreigners stay here for months together
and they can be seen relaxing at the beach or at restaurants reading
books or working on their computers.
</p>

<p>
After sunset the beach road comes alive with the restaurants prepped up
for dinner. We spent most of our evenings here. Some of these places
stealthily serve chilled beer in porcelain mugs. &#x1f60a;

We chose to stay at Soma Palmshore Beach Resort as it was our first
visit to Kovalam and we were not sure of the quality of rooms at the
beach road. The resort is about 10 minutes walk from the happening
beaches of Kovalam. This could be a little bit of inconvenience due to
street dogs if you are returning by walk late at night. But this resort
has a serene private beach.

<p>
The resort is situated on a hilly region and it takes about a minute to
climb down the hill via stairs to reach the private beach. The private
beach is truely private and this makes it a good place for a quiet dip
in the Arabian Sea. We spent hours together playing at the beach and the
pool.

While the restaurants at the beach road provided sea food, we found the
food at the resort to be more authentic and of finer taste. The fresh
pineapple juice that we had with each meal is praiseworthy. The fish and
prawns we had in this place were the best we could find in Kovalam.

The four days we spent in this calm and easy-going beach town motivated
us to explore more Kovalam-like places in future. With this inspiration
we left to Bangalore.
