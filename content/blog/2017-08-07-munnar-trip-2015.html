<!-- title: Munnar Trip 2015 -->
<!-- tag: trip -->
<p>
In November 2015, we went on a trip to Munnar and Alleppey. The plan was
to spend 2 nights in Munnar and then go to Alleppey. Our trip started
with an early morning flight to Cochin. We hired a taxi and it took us
about 3.5 hours to reach our place of stay,
<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g8342248-d1431068-Reviews-Misty_Mountain_Resort-Pallivasal_Munnar_Idukki_District_Kerala.html">Misty
Mountain Resort</a>,
in Munnar. We had a comfortable stay there and the valley view room that
we stayed in provided nice view of the hills. Munnar is famous for tea
and I got hooked to the cardamom tea that I used to have in this hotel.

In the evening, we walked to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g303881-d2390526-Reviews-Punarjani_Traditional_Village-Munnar_Idukki_District_Kerala.html">Punarjani Traditional Village</a> which is situated 300 meters (5 min walk) from
Misty Mountain Resort. We easily got tickets to the Kathakali and
Kalarippayattu (martial art of Kerala) shows. The Kathakali show began at
5:00 PM and the Kalarippayattu show began at 6:00 PM.
</p>

<p>
We were seated at the venue much before the actual show started, so we
could watch one of the Kathakali artists painting his face for the
upcoming show. At the onset of the show, an artist performed
<i>navarasams</i> (nine facial expressions) which was followed by dance
drama series.

We thoroughly enjoyed the Kalarippayattu show. One should not miss
watching Kalarippayattu on visiting Munnar. Here are some of the
pictures that we shot during the show.

On day 2, we set out to explore Munnar. We visited Floriculture centre
and tea plantations on the way to Madupetty Dam. We stopped by to take
pictures of ourselves dressed up as tea plantation workers and with tea
plantations in the background at a place locally called photo point. We
also stopped by to look at a tree full of honeycombs locally called as
honey bee tree. All the routes we took in Munnar were very scenic with
lush green tree plantations.

We spent some time at the reservior near Madupetty Dam. There were small
shops selling traditional crafts and food items. We chose to just sit
and enjoy the scenary of the place. One can go speed boating organized
by DTPC (District Tourist Promotion Council) nearby.

We headed to Echo Point and on the way we visited a place locally called
elephant arrival point. We saw wild elephants grazing at a reserve
forest.
</p>

<p>
True to its name, if you scream at Echo Point, you can
hear your echo. The place is very calm with still water, beautiful hills
and some echos that you create. &#x1f60a; One can go boating too at this
place.

After spending 2 days at Munnar, I came to realize that Munnar has many
more things to offer in terms of nature which we could not experience
due to our short duration of stay. We could not visit the Top Station in
Munnar which gives great views of Western Ghats. I learnt that it is
famous for the <i>Neelakurinji</i> flowers (Strobilanthus), which bloom
once in 12 years. The flowers are violet in colour and the last time
they decorated the hills was in 2006. That makes 2018 a good year to
visit Munnar if one wants to see these flowers blooming.
</p>

<p>
Munnar has beautiful places to visit in four directions, namely
Mattupetty, Coimbatore, Cochin and Thekkady directions, of which we
visited only Mattupetty area and some of the waterfalls in Cochin
direction.
</p>

<p>
It is said that Munnar should be experienced by riding bicycle through
scenic paths as the clouds descend upon you. I am looking forward to
exploring these paths by walk on our next visit to Munnar. We went there
in November. We saw the clouds descending on the hills every evening
after about 3:00 PM. They rose again and hovered above the hills next
day in the morning.

On day 3, we headed towards Alleppey. On the way we visited Munnar
Spices and Ayurvedic Garden. It is a small plantation of medicinal and
spice plants, and a shop selling spices. One may skip this place without
losing much.

On the way to Alleppey, we halted for a while to see the Valara
Waterfalls. A little later, we made another stop to visit Cheeyappara
Waterfalls, a seven tiered waterfall.
